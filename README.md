Your website may be down for all or just some of your visitors. When you use the free outage detector, Uptrends sends a request from over 40 of its 230 checkpoints . Within just a few seconds, you know if your website is down for any one of the worldwide test locations. Red response tiles represent failed uptime tests. Youâ€™ll know how long each test took, and when you hover over the response tile, you get the connection details.

By the way, do you know you can click the SHARE RESULTS button to get a link to your website uptime test? Send the test to your hosting provider to prove your outage or save the results for later.
